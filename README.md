### Hi, I'm Elbert

I am a senior studying computer science at the University of Central Florida. I was previously a Software Engineering Intern at JP Morgan Chase and the lead Mobile Developer for Knight Hacks, UCF's software development and hackathon organization.

Currently, I'm working with the Florida Space Institute on software to support one of NASA's rover competitions.
